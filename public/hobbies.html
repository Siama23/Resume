    <h3>Baking</h3>
    <p>
      I must say it is my hobby N.1. I'm a full-fledged home baker! Here are
      some cinnamon rolls and gingerbread cookies I recently made:

    <h3>Cafe Hopping</h3>
  </li>
  <p>
    It's how I get inspired. Visiting different cafes, working in those
    different environments, taste different foods, collect ideas for my next
    dessert to bake.

    <h3>Traveling</h3>
    <p>
      Since moving to Japan, I never stopped exploring this beautiful country,
      and all it has to offer.
